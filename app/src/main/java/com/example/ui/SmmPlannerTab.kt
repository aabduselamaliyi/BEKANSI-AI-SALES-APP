🔍 BEHIND-THE-SCENES: HOW WE ENSURE YOUR FURNITURE NEVER WARPS! 🔍

Did you know that raw timber contains up to 50% water? If handcrafted immediately, it will shrink, split, and warp as the seasons change in Ethiopia.

At Bekansi, every log of Wanza, Grar, and Mahogany goes through our advanced state-of-the-art kiln-drying chambers for up to 14 days. We extract moisture down to a precise 8%!

This is why we confidently offer a structural warranty of up to 10 years. We season the wood so it stays flat, robust, and beautiful for generations.

Why do cheap furniture joints split after one rainy season in Addis Ababa? Moisture!

At Bekansi we strictly apply dry-kiln treatments:

3️⃣ Moisture meters verify a stable <b>8% threshold</b>

💡 INTERIOR DESIGN TIP: MAXIMIZE APARTMENT SPACE LIKE A PRO! 💡

Living in a compact modern apartment in Addis Ababa? You don't have to sacrifice style for functionality. Here are 3 space-saving laws from our interior designers:

1. EMBRACE FLOATING CONSOLES: Placing our "Bunna" TV credenza on the wall elevates your floor line, creating the illusion of a much bigger saloon area.
2. DISCOVER THE PLATFORM STORAGE BED: Beds occupy the largest footprint. Try our custom Zigba bedframes with drawer storage hidden inside the base structure!
3. CHOOSE LIGHT NATURAL WOODS: Warm honey tones of natural Wanza reflect more ambient light, opening up dark corners.

Apartment living in Addis doesn't have to feel crowded.

Tip 3: Stick to warm, reflective natural timber species.

An average office worker spends up to 2,000 hours per year sitting down. Poor posture leads to chronic back pain and decreases team performance in Addis Ababa.

Ensure your team operates at 100% with these 3 corporate ergonomic essentials:
1. WRIST DEVIATION: Keep desk heights at a standard 75 cm to align elbows naturally.
2. SACRAL SUPPORT: Choose chairs that bolster the lower back cushion.
3. CONDUIT REACH: Document cabinets should stay within arm's reach to avoid strain.

💡 OFFICE BUYERS GUIDE: SOLID HARDWOOD VS. ENGINEERED MDF! 💡

 эмባስ ዎች? Many offices in Addis Ababa purchase low-cost imported MDF desks only to see the wood flake and sag after one year of cup spills and move-handling.

Let's understand why Bekansi solid hardwoods are a smarter capital investment:
• Durability: Solid Mahogany is virtually indestructible. Scratches can be sanded down and revarnished to look new. MDF cannot be repaired once chipped.
• Water Resistance: Wood cup condensation breaks down MDF glues, causing balloon swelling. Our polyurethane sealants shield hardwoods completely.
• Resale Value: Authentic wood items appreciate in value. Imported plastic laminate desks have zero scrap value.

🧼 CARE GUIDE: KEEP YOUR BESPOKE WOOD FURNITURE SHINING FOR 50+ YEARS! 🧼

Solid hardwood furniture is a real investment. To ensure your Wanza, Grar, or Mahogany items stay gorgeous for decades, follow our master carpenters' 3 care rules:

1. THE WATER Condensed Rule: Never leave wet glasses directly on wood veneers. Water breaks down clear coat varnishes, leading to white rings. Use coasters!
2. CHOOSE THE RIGHT OIL: Clean once a month with natural bees wax oil. Avoid chemical sprays containing silicone which build up a sticky, dust-grabbing layer.
3. SHIELD FROM SUNLIGHT: Direct scorching midday sun can dry wood, leading to splits. Position dining tables slightly away from direct windows.

Keep your wood healthy. Talk to our technical support team for free care advice!
